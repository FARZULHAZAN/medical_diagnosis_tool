    "2.  **Match the Format:** If the original is a question, the paraphrase must be a question. If it is a command or statement, the paraphrase must be a command or statement.\n"
    "3.  **Vary the Structure:** Use different vocabulary and sentence structure. Avoid simply swapping a few synonyms.\n"
    "4.  **Handle Ambiguity:** If the original query is ambiguous (e.g., uses subjective words like 'best' or 'interesting'), the paraphrase must retain that same ambiguity. Do not try to make it more specific.\n"
